# Gravity as a Geometric Phase Operator

This repository contains the LaTeX source, figures, and supporting material for the paper:

**“Gravity as a Geometric Phase Operator:  
A Simple Interpretation of the New Matter-Wave Equivalence Principle Tests.”**

Recent matter-wave interferometry experiments  
([arXiv:2502.14535](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14535))  
demonstrate that gravitational curvature modifies the *phase* of quantum states  
while leaving their coherence intact.

This behaviour supports a geometry-first interpretation of gravity:

- superposition remains coherent,  
- interference visibility is preserved,  
- and only the *geometric phase* shifts under curvature.

## Summary

The new matter-wave equivalence tests provide direct evidence that gravity acts as a **geometric phase operator**.  
Instead of inducing wavefunction collapse, curvature determines the allowable phase evolution of quantum states.

This repository provides a clean, academically grounded explanation of this phenomenon and its implications for unifying quantum theory and gravity.
